<h1>Building the Tardis Desk</h1>
<h2>An interactive standing desk for working from home</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago I got interested in the idea of building a standing desk for those times when I was working from home. 
I was then using a bog-standard sitting desk and had moved my office around the house as DIY projects and family demands dictated.</p>
<p>I had started to measure things up and sketched out a design for the desk frame when coincidentally yet another redecoration 
project made an old wardrobe redundant. As I started emptying it and thought about smashing it to bits, the carcass suddenly 
seemed to me to be about the same dimensions as the desk I had planned.</p>
<p>Never being one to waste money or wood, I fitted some extra shelving inside the wardrobe, installed my PC and a couple of monitors 
and hey presto, a functional standing desk practically for free.</p>
