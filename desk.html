<h1>Building the Tardis Desk</h1>
<h2>An interactive standing desk for working from home</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago I got interested in the idea of building a standing desk for those times when I was working from home. 
I was then using a bog-standard sitting desk and had moved my office around the house as DIY projects and family demands dictated.</p>
<p>I had started to measure things up and sketched out a design for the desk frame when coincidentally yet another redecoration 
project made an old wardrobe redundant. As I started emptying it and thought about smashing it to bits, the carcass suddenly 
seemed to me to be about the same dimensions as the desk I had planned.</p>
<p>Never being one to waste money or wood, I fitted some extra shelving inside the wardrobe, installed my PC and a couple of monitors 
and hey presto, a functional standing desk practically for free.</p>
<h3>Becoming a Tardis</h3>
<p>Functional but boring, so I began to think about giving it a lick of paint. I decided to pick a theme based on a possibly the 
  most famous standing desk of all time - the Tardis</p>
<p>I had to chisel off the faux-deco panels to get 2 flat doors, then made some framing panels from MDF, pinned and glued them 
  into place and gave the whole thing a couple of coats of dark blue paint. I wasn't too fussed about the quality of the finish as I wanted 
  it to look a bit weather-beaten.</p>
<p>I masked off the top panel in each door to let the white undercoat show through for the top windows(?). A black POLICE BOX 
  roof sign and the white FOR USE OF PUBLIC door signs were printed off and the Tardis was complete. Even more complete that Xmas 
when I was gifted a revolving police light.</p>
